The current economic situation in Nigeria, which is considered a middle-income,
mixed economy and an emerging market, has various effects on its citizens. The
economy's heavy reliance on oil revenues, despite oil contributing only about 9%
to the GDP, could lead to economic instability, especially with fluctuating
global oil prices. The struggling agricultural sector, which has not kept up
with rapid population growth, could lead to food insecurity and increased
dependence on food imports. The country's efforts to manage its debt, such as
reaching agreements with organizations like the Paris Club, could potentially
lead to austerity measures that might affect public services and the welfare of
the citizens.
