Post-1978 economic reforms China's average GDP growth had been over 10% annually for over three decades, and in some years, growth exceeded 14% annually.[36][37][needs update]\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods.[38] However, exports as a percentage of GDP\n has steadily dropped to just around 20%, reflecting its decreasing \nimportance to the Chinese economy. Nevertheless, it remains the largest \ntrading nation in the world and plays a prominent role in international trade.[39][40] Manufacturing has been transitioning toward high-tech industries such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, telecommunications and IT equipment, and services has also grown as a percentage of GDP. It is also the world's fastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods.[41]\n China is also the world's largest consumer of numerous commodities, and\n accounts for about half of global consumption of metals.[42] China is a net importer of services products.[43] China was the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world as of 2020, receiving inflows of $163\u00a0billion.[44] but more recently, inbound FDI has fallen sharply to negative levels.[45][46] It has the second largest outbound FDI, at US$136.91 billion for 2019.[47]\nChina has the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves worth $3.1\u00a0trillion,[48]\n but if the foreign assets of China's state-owned commercial banks are \nincluded, the value of China's reserves rises to nearly $4\u00a0trillion.[49] China faced a mild economic slowdown during the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and initiated a massive stimulus package,\n which helped to regain its economic growth.

future Premier Li Keqiang\n said he is far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling \nthem \"man-made\" and unreliable and that data releases, especially the \nGDP numbers, should be used \"for reference only\".[127] In its place, he developed the Li Keqiang index is an alternative measurement of Chinese economic performance that uses three variables he preferred.[128]\nChinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking \ntheir numbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose \nperformance are often assessed based on how well their respective \neconomies have performed.[129] Local governments have come under increased scrutiny over the last few years over economic data, with CCP general secretary Xi Jinping\n stating that economic data forgery \"not only hurt our judgment of the \neconomic situation, but also seriously undermined the Communist Party\u2019s \nideas and truth-seeking style\".[124][130]\nAccording to a 2019 research paper published by the Brookings Institution adjusting the historical GDP time series using value-added tax data, which the authors said are \"highly resistant to fraud and tampering\",[131][132]\n China's economic growth may have been overstated by 1.7 percent each \nyear between 2008 and 2016, meaning that the government may have been \noverstating the size of the Chinese economy by 12\u201316 percent in 2016.[132][133]\nSeveral Western academics and institutions have supported the claim that China's economy is likely to be underestimated.[134][135][136][125][137][138][139] A paper by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research claimed that China's economic growth may be higher than what is reported by official statistics.[140] An article by Hunter Clarka, Maxim Pinkovskiya and Xavier Sala-i-Martin published by the Elsevier Science Direct\n in 2018 employs an innovative method of satellite-recorded nighttime \nlights, which the authors claim to be a best-unbiased predictor of the \neconomic growth in Chinese cities. The results suggest that the Chinese \neconomic growth rate is higher than the official reported data.[134]\nSatellite measurements of light pollution\n are used by some analysts to model Chinese economic growth and suggest \ngrowth rate numbers in Chinese official data are more reliable, though \nare likely to be smoothed.[141] According to an article by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,\n China's official statistics are of a high quality compared to other \ndeveloping, middle-income and low-income countries. In 2016, China was \nat the 83rd percentile of middle and low-income countries, up from the \n38th percentile in 2004.[142] A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n found that China's official GDP statistics are \"significantly and \npositively correlated\" with externally verifiable measures of economic \nactivity such as import and export data from China's trade partners, \nsuggesting that China's economic growth was no slower than the official \nfigures indicated.[125]\nThe study by Daniel H. Rosen and Beibei Bao, published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies\n in 2015, showed that GDP in 2008 was actually 13\u201316 percent bigger than\n the official data, while 2013 GDP was accurately at $10.5\u00a0trillion rather than the official figure at $9.5\u00a0trillion.[137] According to a research conducted by Arvind Subramanian, a former economist at the International Money Fund (IMF) and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the size of the Chinese economy by Purchasing Power Parity\n in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion rather than an official estimate at \n$10.1 trillion by IMF, meaning that China's GDP was underestimated by 47\n percent.[136]\n\nNational debt\nMain article: National debt of China\nIn 2022, China's total government debt stood at approximately CN\u00a5 94 trillion (US$ 14 trillion), equivalent to about 77.1% of GDP.[143] In 2014, many analysts expressed concern over the overall size of China's government debt.[144][145][146][147]\n At the end of 2014, the International Monetary Fund reported that \nChina's general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 41.44 percent.", "start_char_idx": 20783, "end_char_idx": 25001, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ace0586-6943-4c80-9ee8-e6bdbe41727f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ace0586-6943-4c80-9ee8-e6bdbe41727f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "main", "tag_id": "content", "file_path": "data/Economy_of_China.html"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff7fc7e6-b342-4cc8-8158-e3dc12f70366", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"tag": "main", "tag_id": "content", "file_path": "data/Economy_of_China.html"}, "hash": "dab241bfd85bb2f86928af77792c268bbdb324bb12c4aae3b556e1e7c72f7e61", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd0805d6-0b5f-4f84-9133-9a6bd38ea8e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"tag": "main", "tag_id": "content", "file_path": "data/Economy_of_China.html"}, "hash": "c7a84b57661c9942ab9b201d0979a0ccd32ecd2972d11f408215d90d236aab17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "24e5eb56-d6d3-4937-972b-2c8ba6db5df0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3272ea1abcbf787325f11ed7cea226978470af6f6a57476679fe0f17440ed217", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[136]\n\nNational debt\nMain article: National debt of China\nIn 2022, China's total government debt stood at approximately CN\u00a5 94 trillion (US$ 14 trillion), equivalent to about 77.1% of GDP.[143] In 2014, many analysts expressed concern over the overall size of China's government debt.[144][145][146][147]\n At the end of 2014, the International Monetary Fund reported that \nChina's general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio was 41.44 percent.[148][149]\n In 2015, a report by the International Monetary Fund concluded that \nChina's public debt is relatively low \"and on a stable path in all \nstandard stress tests except for the scenario with contingent liability \nshocks\", such as \"a large-scale bank recapitalization or financial \nsystem bailout to deal, for example, with a potential rise in NPLs from deleveraging\".[150]\nChinese authorities have dismissed analysts' worries, insisting \"the country still has room to increase government debt.\"[151] Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, earlier in 2016, commented that \"the\u00a0... debt pile facing China [is] an 'internal' problem, given the majority of the borrowings was issued in local currency.[152] A 2019 survey by the OECD found that China's corporate debt is higher than other major countries.[153]\n\"Shadow banking\" has risen in China, posing risks to the financial system.[154][155] Off the books debt is a grey area, but estimates place the amount for local governments alone as high as $9 trillion[156] or 63 trillion yuan, up from estimates of around 30 trillion yuan in 2020.[157]\n\nRegulatory environment and government revenues\nMain article: Taxation in China\nThough China's economy has expanded rapidly, its regulatory \nenvironment has not kept pace. Since Deng Xiaoping's open market \nreforms, the growth of new businesses has outpaced the government's \nability to regulate them. This has created a situation where businesses,\n faced with mounting competition and poor oversight, take drastic \nmeasures to increase profit margins, often at the expense of consumer safety.\n This issue became more prominent in 2007, with a number of restrictions\n being placed on problematic Chinese exports by the United States.[158]\n\nData\nSee also: Historical GDP of ChinaThis section needs to be updated.

inflation 1987\u20132022Pork\n is an important part of the Chinese economy with a per capita \nconsumption of 90 grams per day. The worldwide rise in the price of \nanimal feed associated with increased production of ethanol from corn \nresulted in steep rises in pork prices in China in 2007. Increased cost \nof production interacted badly with increased demand resulting from \nrapidly rising wages. The state responded by subsidizing pork prices for\n students and the urban poor and called for increased production. \nRelease of pork from the nation's strategic pork reserve was considered.[159]\nInvestment cycles\nBeijing Financial Street\nChinese investment has always been highly cyclical.[160]\nIn China, the majority of investment is carried out by entities \nthat are at least partially state-owned. Most of these are under the \ncontrol of local governments. Thus, booms are primarily the result of perverse incentives at the local-government level.[161]\n Unlike entrepreneurs in a free-enterprise economy, Chinese local \nofficials are motivated primarily by political considerations. As their \nperformance evaluations are based, to a large extent, on GDP growth \nwithin their jurisdictions, they have a strong incentive to promote \nlarge-scale investment projects.[162][163]\nA typical cycle begins with a relaxation of central government \ncredit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push \ninvestment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control\n directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private \ninvestors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions.[164]\n The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result \nin shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as was the case\n in 2003).[165]\n Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten \nsocial stability, the central government will intervene by tightening \nenforcement of industrial and credit policy. Projects that went ahead \nwithout required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular \ntypes of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and \ninvestment growth begins to decline.[166]\n\nFinancial and banking system\nMain articles: Banking in China, Foreign-exchange reserves of China, Hedge fund industry in China, and China Venture Capital Association\nChina bond yields \u00a0\u00a030 year bond \u00a0\u00a010 year bond \u00a0\u00a02 year bond \u00a0\u00a01 year bond\nChina has the world's largest total banking sector assets of around $45.838\u00a0trillion (309.41\u00a0trillion CNY) with $42.063\u00a0trillion in total deposits and other liabilities.[167] Most of China's financial institutions are state-owned and governed.[168] The chief instruments of financial and fiscal control are the People's Bank of China (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance, both under the authority of the State Council.

Much of that total \nis believed by outside observers to be nonperforming.[171]\n Increasing amounts of funds are made available through the banks for \neconomic and commercial purposes. Foreign sources of capital have also \nincreased. China has received loans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from countries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks.

Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds,\n furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. \nAgricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish,\n grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high \nbecause of intensive cultivation,\n for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but \nChina still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United \nStates.

China is the world's leading producer of pigs, chickens, and\n eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since the \nmid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the livestock output. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of aquaculture. Pond raising has always been important and has been increasingly emphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by overfishing and to provide such valuable export commodities as prawns.\n China is also unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada \nwith anywhere from 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as \nArgentina. Fueled primarily by government subsidies, its growth and \nactivities have largely gone unchecked.[196]\n\nTimber transported from a woodlot in the hills of Zhangpu County, Fujian\nEnvironmental problems such as floods, drought, and erosion pose \nserious threats to farming in many parts of the country. The wholesale \ndestruction of forests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate, and forest resources are still fairly meagre.[197] The principal forests are found in the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked extensively, and much of the country's timber comes from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan.\nWestern China, comprising Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, has little agricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and cattle raising. Rice, China's most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces and many of the farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of the greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each other for the top place. Millet and kaoliang\n (a variety of grain sorghum) are grown mainly in the northeast and some\n central provinces, which, together with some northern areas, also \nprovide considerable quantities of barley. Most of the soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is grown in the center and the north, while tea\n comes mainly from the warm and humid hilly areas of the south. Cotton \nis grown extensively in the central provinces, but it is also found to a\n lesser extent in the southeast and in the north. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important crops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.\n\nFish ponds near Daye, Hubei\nIn the past decade, the government has been encouraging agricultural mechanization and land consolidation to raise yields and compensate for the loss of rural workers who have migrated to the cities.[198]\n According to statistics by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, \nthe annual growth rate of agricultural mechanization in China is 6.4%. \nBy 2014, the integrated mechanization rate had risen to nearly 60%, with\n the rate for wheat surpassing 90% and that for maize approaching 80%.[199]\n In addition to standard agricultural equipment like tractors, China's \nagriculture cooperatives have begun using high-tech equipment, including\n unmanned aerial vehicles, which are used to spay crops with pesticides.[200] Good progress has been made in increasing water conservancy, and about half the cultivated land is under irrigation.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms were \nintroduced.

As a \nresult, many Chinese citizens own multiple properties, as they are one \nof the few ways in which it is comparatively easy to grow and preserve \nwealth. Due to this, many economists have speculated about a property \nbubble within the Chinese economy[202]\n On 16 July 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the housing \nmarket within the Chinese economy had grown to US$52 trillion, eclipsing\n the US 2008 housing market before the Financial Crisis.[203]\nDespite the possibility of a housing bubble, many people still \nchoose to invest their assets in real estate market.

Some 80 percent of all\n power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang.[210]\n Though China has rich overall energy potential, most have yet to be \ndeveloped. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts \nmost of these resources relatively far from their major industrial \nusers. The northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70\u201375% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction.\n According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by \nover 25%. As of at least 2023, solar power has become cheaper than \ncoal-fired power in China.[116]:\u200a167\u200a\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion\n of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of \nthe processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5 million barrels (560,000\u00a0m3)\n per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its\n oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is \ndeveloping oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields.[211]\n Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which \ncurrently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and \nincorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan\n (2001\u20132005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a 2% share of \ntotal energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. \nenergy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas \nto more than double by 2010.\nSince the early 2000s, China's clean energy sector has rapidly developed.[212]:\u200a23\u200a This growth has enabled renewable energy to have an important role in China's international cooperation, including South-South cooperation in which China is a major source of clean energy technology transfer to other developing countries.[212]:\u200a4,\u200a23\u200a As of at least 2023, China is the world's leading producer of solar panels and wind turbines.[116]:\u200a167\u200a\nThe 11th Five-Year Program\n (2006\u201310), announced in 2005 and approved by the National People's \nCongress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures,\n including development of renewable energy sources and increased \nattention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% \nreduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010.

However, the carbon intensity of China's GDP\u2014the amount of carbon used to generate a unit of output\u2014remains relatively high.[104] To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost[215] of environmental pollution in China,[216][217] it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern and Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment\n that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial \ndevelopment with low carbon dioxide emissions and better allocation of \nnational resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic \ngrowth in order to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry. This is \nin accord with the planning goals of the central government.[218]\n Contrary to the publicized goals, China is building a large number of \ncoal fired power plants and it carbon emissions could further increase.[219] [220]\nMining\nSee also: Gold mining in China\nChina's rapid industrialization requires imports of minerals from abroad. In particular, iron ore imports from Australia and the United States have soared in the early 2000s as steel production\n rapidly outstripped domestic iron ore production.

Anthracite is present in several places (especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall, it is not very significant.[244]\nTo ensure a more even distribution of coal supplies and to reduce the strain on the less than adequate transportation network, the authorities pressed for the development of a large number of small, locally run mines\n throughout the country. This campaign was energetically pursued after \nthe 1960s, with the result that thousands of small pits have been \nestablished, and they produce more than half the country's coal. This \noutput, however, is typically expensive and is used for local \nconsumption. It has also led to a less than stringent implementation of \nsafety measures in these unregulated mines, which cause several \nthousands of deaths each year.[245]\nCoal\n makes up the bulk of China's energy consumption (70% in 2005, 55% in \n2021), and China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the \nworld. As China's economy continues to grow, China's coal demand is \nprojected to rise significantly. Although coal's share of China's \noverall energy consumption will decrease, coal consumption will continue\n to rise in absolute terms.

Oil shale is found in a number of places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality light oil has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin\n in Xinjiang. The country consumes most of its oil output but does \nexport some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed\n oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.\nIn 2013, the pace of China's economic growth exceeded the \ndomestic oil capacity and floods damaged the nation's oil fields in the \nmiddle of the year. Consequently, China imported oil to compensate for \nthe supply reduction and surpassed the US in September 2013 to become \nthe world's largest importer of oil.[246]\nAs of at least 2024, Chinese gasoline prices for consumers are among the lowest in the world.[116]:\u200a105\u200a\nThe total extent of China's natural gas reserves is unknown, as relatively little exploration for natural gas has been done.[247] Sichuan accounts for almost half of the known natural gas reserves and production.[248] Most of the rest of China's natural gas is associated gas produced in the Northeast's major oil fields, especially Daqing oilfield. Other gas deposits have been found in the Qaidam Basin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, and offshore to the southwest of Hainan.[249]\n According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by \neconomists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan\n University in China), financial development in China has not taken \nplace at the expense of environmental pollution and financial \ndevelopment has led to a decrease in environmental pollution.

In November 1991, China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which promotes free trade\n and cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, and technology \nspheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001, and Shanghai hosted the \nannual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nChina became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.[326]\n The completion of its accession protocol and Working Party Report paved\n the way for its entry into the WTO on 11 December 2001, after 16 years \nof negotiations, the longest in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n However, U.S. exporters continue to have concerns about fair market \naccess due to China's restrictive trade policies and U.S. export \nrestrictions.

From the beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign \ninvestment, capital inflows expanded every year until 1999.[337] Foreign-invested enterprises account for 58\u201360% of China's imports and exports.[338]\nSince the early 1990s, the government has allowed foreign \ninvestors to manufacture and sell a wide range of goods on the domestic \nmarket, eliminated time restrictions on the establishment of joint \nventures, provided some assurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs of joint venture\n boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly foreign-owned \nenterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more \npreferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises\n and contractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in \nselected economic zones or in projects encouraged by the state.\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in \nShanghai and allowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of\n stock \nin selected companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities \nExchanges. These \"B\" shares sold to foreigners carried no ownership \nrights in a company. In 1997, China approved 21,046 foreign investment \nprojects and received over $45\u00a0billion \nin foreign direct investment. China revised significantly its laws on \nWholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and China Foreign Equity Joint Ventures\n in 2000 and 2001.

Formerly foreign ownership was limited to a 49% \nstake in these firms.[339]\nForeign investment remains a strong element in China's rapid \nexpansion in world trade and has been an important factor in the growth \nof urban jobs. China's economic leadership on global capital flows \nemphasizes long-term infrastructure and development finance over \nshort-term flows which, under the current order, have imposed large \ncosts on many economies.[340] In 1998, foreign-invested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign exchange reserves totaled about $145\u00a0billion.\n Foreign-invested enterprises today produce about half of China's \nexports (the majority of China's foreign investment come from Hong Kong,\n Macau \nand Taiwan), and China continues to attract large investment inflows. \nHowever, the Chinese government's emphasis on guiding FDI into \nmanufacturing has led to market saturation in some industries, while \nleaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993 to 2001, \nChina was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) after the United States, receiving $39\u00a0billion in 1999 and $41\u00a0billion in 2000. China is now one of the leading FDI recipients in the world, receiving almost $80\u00a0billion in 2005 according to World Bank statistics. In 2006, China received $69.47\u00a0billion.[341] By 2011, with the U.S. seeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis, China overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280\u00a0billion that year.[342]\nAmid slowing economic conditions and a weakening yuan in 2015, December of that year saw a 5.8% drop in FDI to China.[343]\n While China's rank as the top receiver of FDI continued through 2014, \nthe slowing of inbound investment in 2015 combined with a massive \nrebound in foreign investment to the United States resulted in the U.S. \nreclaiming its position as the top investment destination.[344] Data from the American Chamber of Commerce in China's 2016 China Business Climate Survey\n confirms this trend, although it also demonstrates that China remains a\n top investment destination. This survey of over 500 members found that \n\"China remains a top three investment priority for six out of ten member\n companies,\" though this is a decline from the 2012 high of eight out of\n ten respondents considering China a top priority.[345]\nForeign exchange reserves totaled $155\u00a0billion in 1999 and $165\u00a0billion in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded $800\u00a0billion in 2005, more than doubling from 2003. Foreign exchange reserves were $819\u00a0billion at the end of 2005, $1.066\u00a0trillion at the end of 2006, $1.9\u00a0trillion\n by June 2008. In addition, by the end of September 2008 China replaced \nJapan for the first time as the largest foreign holder of US treasury \nsecurities with a total of $585\u00a0billion, vs Japan $573\u00a0billion. China's foreign exchange reserves are the largest in the world.[346]\nAs part of its WTO accession, China undertook to eliminate \ncertain trade-related investment measures and to open up specified \nsectors that had previously been closed to foreign investment. New laws,\n regulations, and administrative measures to implement these commitments\n are being issued. Major remaining barriers to foreign investment \ninclude opaque and inconsistently enforced laws and regulations and the \nlack of a rules-based legal infrastructure.

Such \ninvestments offer access to expertise in marketing and distribution \npotentially useful in exploiting the developing Chinese domestic market.[355]\nSince 2005, Chinese companies have been actively expanding \noutside of China, in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, \nChinese companies invested US$90\u00a0billion globally in non-financial sectors, 16% more than 2012.[356]\nBetween January 2009 and December 2013, China contributed a total of $161.03bn in outward FDI,\n creating almost 300,000 jobs.

During 2003, 49% of the \nlabor force worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other categories. In 2004 some 25 million persons were employed by 743,000 private enterprises.\nThe 2010 census found that China was now half urban and rapidly \naging due to the one child policy. This is expected to lead to increased\n demand for labor to take care of an elderly population and a reduced \nsupply of migrant labor from the countryside.[364]\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to statistics released by \nChina's National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the size of the \nlabor force, people aged 15 to 59, in China shrank slightly to 937.27 \nmillion people, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, \nresulting from China's one-child policy of population control, is \nanticipated to continue to at least 2030.[citation needed]\nIn January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[365] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[366] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[367]\nDue to worsening pollution, the corruption and political uncertainties of the one-party state\n and the limited economic freedom in an economy dominated by large \nstate-owned enterprises, many skilled professionals are either leaving \nthe country or preparing safety nets for themselves abroad.[368][369][370] In the decade up to 2014, ten million Chinese emigrated to other countries, taking assets and their technical skills.[371]\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions\n is the country's only legally permissible trade union.

During most of \nthe 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the same time \nold ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of \nregional transportation became the responsibility of the local \ngovernments, and many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also\n placed on developing transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and \nforested areas, in order to integrate poorer regions of the country and \nto help promote economies of scale in the agricultural sector.[citation needed]\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's \ntransportation links were mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and \naccess to the inner regions was generally poor. This situation has been \nimproved considerably since then, as railways and highways have been \nbuilt in the remote and frontier regions of the northwest and southwest.\n At the same time, the development of international transportation was \nalso pursued, and the scope of ocean shipping was broadened considerably.[citation needed]\nFreight haulage is mainly provided by rail transport. The rail sector is monopolized by China Railway\n and there is wide variation in services provided. In late 2007 China \nbecame one of the few countries in the world to launch its own \nindigenously developed high-speed train.[375]\n As rail capacity is struggling to meet demand for the transport of \ngoods and raw materials such as coal, air routes, roads and waterways \nare rapidly being developed to provide an increasing proportion of \nChina's overall transportation needs.[376]\nSome economic experts have argued that the development gap \nbetween China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and\n India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on \nambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of \nits GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging \neconomies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable \nspending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal \nconditions while many South American economies suffered from various \ndevelopment bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging \npower grids and mediocre schools.[377]\n\nScience and technology\nMain article: Science and technology in China\nTencent, one of the world's most valuable technology conglomerates\nScience and technology in China has in recent decades developed \nrapidly. The Chinese government has placed emphasis through funding, \nreform, and societal status on science and technology as a fundamental \npart of the socio-economic development of the country as well as for \nnational prestige. China has made rapid advances in areas such as \neducation, infrastructure, high-tech manufacturing, artificial \nintelligence,[378] academic publishing, patents\n and commercial applications. China is now increasingly targeting \nindigenous innovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses.

That\u2019s enough to get by in many Chinese cities, especially \nif you own your home.

About 542 million people are covered by the urban and \nrural residents pension scheme, with 161 million currently receiving \npayments. In 2020, 335 billion yuan was paid out under the scheme, \nequivalent to just 174 yuan for each person per month. This is not \nenough for someone to live on in even the smallest villages. In \ncomparison, the urban employee pension plan paid out 5,130 billion yuan \nto retirees in 2020, with 128 million of them receiving around 3,350 \nyuan per month (around 70 percent of the average salary received by \nemployees in private companies in urban areas).
